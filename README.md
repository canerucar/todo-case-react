## Todo App with React

### To-do app developed with Component Driven Development using React and redux.

### Technologies I use

#### `React, Redux Toolkit, SASS, json-server`

### SETUP ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

- I didn't need to hide the env file as I was using json-server.
- Copy the project to your local.
- Open with VScode.

```bash
yarn install
#or
npm install

yarn start
# or
npm run start
```
